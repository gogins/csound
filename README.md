# CSOUND-EXTENDED

Version 0.1.0
Michael Gogins

This repository contains various extensions to Csound that have been moved out of 
the core Csound Git repository at xxx. These extensions include:

1. CsoundAC, an algorithmic composition library designed to be used with Csound, 
   with C++, Python, Java, and Lua interfaces.
   
2. CsoundVST, Csound in the form of a VST plugin.

3. csound.node, a C++ add-on that embeds Csound in the JavaScript context of Web 
   pages running in nwjs from xxx.
   
4. CHSound, a lightweight editor and "front end" for Csound that embeds HTML5 capabilities 
   for Csound.

This repository uses the core Csound repository, and some other third-party dependencies, 
as Git submodules.
