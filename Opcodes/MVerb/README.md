# MVerb

MVerb - Implements Jon Christopher Nelson's waveguide mesh reverb.
 
## Description

Implements Jon Christopher Nelson's waveguide mesh reverb, originally created 
as a Cabbage VST plugin, as a C++ Csound plugin opcode.

MVerb is a modified five-by-five 2D waveguide mesh reverberator. It is highly 
flexible and can generate compelling and unique effects timbres ranging from 
traditional spaces to infinite morphing spaces or the simulation of metallic 
plates or cymbals. The plugin incorporates a 10-band parametric equalizer for 
timbral control and delay randomization to create more unusual effects.

## Initialization

*Spreset* -- Name of a built-in preset, one of: "Small Hall", "Medium Hall", "Large Hall", "Huge Hall", "Infinite Space", "Dry Echo", "Right-Left", "Comby 1", "Comby 2", "Octaves", "TriTones", "Big Dark", "Metallic 1", "Weird 1", "Weird 2", "Weird 3", "Large Cymbal 1", "Large Cymbal 2", "Splash Cymbal 1", "Splash Cymbal 2", "Turkish Cymbal", "Gong", "Small Gong", "Metallic 2", "Tubular Metallic", "Cowbell", "Finger Cymbal", "Bell", "Chinese Ball", "Cymbal Cap", "Baking Sheet", "Frying Pan", "Squeak", "Trellace", "Monkey Wrench"
"Small Hall", "Medium Hall", "Large Hall", "Huge Hall", "Infinite Space", "Dry Echo", "Right-Left", "Comby 1", "Comby 2", "Octaves", "TriTones", "Big Dark", "Metallic 1", "Weird 1", "Weird 2", "Weird 3", "Large Cymbal 1", "Large Cymbal 2", "Splash Cymbal 1", "Splash Cymbal 2", "Turkish Cymbal", "Gong", "Small Gong", "Metallic 2", "Tubular Metallic", "Cowbell", "Finger Cymbal", "Bell", "Chinese Ball", "Cymbal Cap", "Baking Sheet", "Frying Pan", "Squeak", "Trellace", "Monkey Wrench".

The order of initialization is:

1. Default values of all parameters.
2. The user's choice of preset determines most parameters.
3. The user can override any parameter(s) using opcode parameters.

## Performance

- *res16* -- Resonant frequency of node 16 in the mesh.
- *res17* -- Resonant frequency of node 17 in the mesh.
- *res18* -- Resonant frequency of node 18 in the mesh.
- *res19* -- Resonant frequency of node 19 in the mesh.
- *res20* -- Resonant frequency of node 20 in the mesh.
- *res21* -- Resonant frequency of node 21 in the mesh.
- *res22* -- Resonant frequency of node 22 in the mesh.
- *res23* -- Resonant frequency of node 23 in the mesh.
- *res24* -- Resonant frequency of node 24 in the mesh.
- *res25* -- Resonant frequency of node 25 in the mesh.
- *ERselect* -- Name of the early reflections preset, one of: "None","Small","Medium","Large","Huge","Long Random","Short Backwards","Long Backwards","Strange1","Strange2".
- *ERamp* -- Amplitude of early reflections.
- *DFact* -- Amount (size) of early reflections.
- *FB* -- Delay feedback (size) of mesh.
- *FBclear* -- Amount by which delay lines are attenuated.
- *Q* -- Q of the equalizer filters.
- *EQselect* -- Name of the equalization preset, one of: "flat", "high cut 1", "high cut 2", "low cut 1", "low cut 2", "band pass 1", "band pass 2", "2 bands", "3 bands", "evens", "odds".
- *eq1* -- Gain of equalizer band 1.

The order of processing is:

1.  2 DC blockers for the stereo input signal.
2.  2 multitap delays for stereo early reflections.
3.  25 mesh nodes for the reverb, each with:
    1.  4 variable delays, with optionally randomized delay times.
    1.  4 equalizers, each with:    
        1.  10 parametric biquad filters.
        2.  1 level balancer.
        3.  1 DC blocker.        
4.  2 DC blockers for the stereo output signal.
