## Introduction

This directory contains a Haskell module that exposes the Csound shared 
library as a Haskell module. 

This includes a `playCsound` function that renders a Euterpea Music object 
using Csound. This can be used with Euterpea, the Haskell School of Music, 
Kulitta, Jazzkell, and relatives.
