# HTML5 Empowering Csound

This repository contains samples of integrating HTML5 capabilities with Csound, where the PNaCl build of Csound is used, so that Csound itself does not need to be installed. These examples should play in any desktop version, 31 or later, of Google's Chrome browser, on Windows, Linux, or OS X. Click on the link below to play the example.
