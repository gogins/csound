# CSOUND-EXTENDED WEBASSEMBY LIVE EXAMPLES


Csound for WebAssembly implements almost all features of Csound as a WebAssembly 
module that will run Csound from a JavaScript interface in any current 
Web browser. This version includes useful plugin opcodes statically 
linked. Some live examples run from here:
    
1. [Minimal.html](https://gogins.github.io/csound-extended/minimal.html), a very basic example.
2. [Message from Another Planet](https://gogins.github.io/csound-extended/message.html), shows how to use interactive user controls.
3. [Scrims](https://gogins.github.io/csound-extended/scrims.html), shows interactive controls, real-time 3-dimensional fractal graphics, chord transformations.
