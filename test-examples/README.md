## Introduction

This directory contains a number of functional examples that can be used to 
test that the csound-extended-dev package and other things that I maintain are 
basically working after installation. 

These examples also demonstrate some, but by no means all, of the features and 
capabilities of csound-extended-dev, csound-extended-wasm, csound-aeolus 
(available from xxx), and csound-vst (available from). As such, these examples 
can serve as templates for new compositions.
