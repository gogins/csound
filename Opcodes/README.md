# Plugin Opcodes

Plugin opcodes for Csound that currently are packaged with csound-extended are 
maintained here.

To use the STK opcodes, you must set an environment variable `RAWWAVE_PATH` to 
point to the directory containg the STK library's rawwaves files, e.g.
`/usr/share/stk/rawwaves`.

Some other opcodes, either maintained elsewhere or of historical interest, are 
saved here in the `archived` subdirectory.
